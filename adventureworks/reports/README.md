# Evidence Template Project

Welcome to Evidence. Use this project template to get started.

## Getting Started

Check out the docs for [alternative install methods](https://docs.evidence.dev/getting-started/install-evidence) including Docker, Github Codespaces, and alongside dbt.

```shell
npx degit evidence-dev/template my-project
cd my-project 
npm install 
npm run dev 
```

Once you've launched Evidence, this project includes a short tutorial to help you get started.

Don't clone this repo, just download the code using the steps above.

## Codespaces

If you are using this template in Codespaces, use the following commands to get started:

```shell
npm install
npm run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0
```

See [the CLI docs](https://docs.evidence.dev/cli/) for more command information.

**Note:** Codespaces is much faster on the Desktop app. After the Codespace has booted, select the hamburger menu â†’ Open in VS Code Desktop.
